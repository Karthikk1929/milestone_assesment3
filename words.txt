It's a truly pleasant experience to read this book, actually I should confess that I laughed A LOT in the reading. The book is hilarious.

Besides the fun part, I was inspired by this book too. This book went through the early history of Personal Computer industry, gave the vivid silhouettes of the people, the companies and Silicon Valley in this industry. Mr.Cringely examined why today's Information Technology industry is what it is now, and how it became like this.

The book provided the facts and opinion about how the high tech companies succeeded, and how many more failed. Why Bill Gates is the richest person in the world, and how Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the most beloved high tech company in the world.

It used to say that reading history can make people understand the rise and fall of things. We can learn the lessons from it, and get new ideas or patterns from the past success. Today Personal Computer is declining, and the focus is shifting to Smart Phone and Tablet. Although product is changing, the similar struggles, fights, winning and loss are still happening lively everyday in this industry, just like what it did in the old days.
